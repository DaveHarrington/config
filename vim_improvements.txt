Organise shortcuts

    Shortcuts for:
        paste current 0 register in insert mode
        vimgrep current word
        grep current word
        0 register should be easier
        jump to definition of word under cursor

    Split window at the bottom that:
        Shows the definition of a variable on shortcut

    Macros:
        Insert/remove pdb

        Comment at pos 0
        split long lines properly
        line up dictionaries automatically
        Clean a blank line, but keep tabbing
        Yank, comment and paste
        Select Python block
